## Folder Structure

- `/Array/`  
  Contains all the design files necessary to fabricate the ultrasonic transducer array.  
  - `/3D_printed_parts/` : Contains 3D model files (both `.stl` and `.step`) for the physical structure of the transducer array. Both formats represent the same model.  
  - `/gerber/` : PCB Gerber files for fabricating the circuit board used in the array  
  - `/laserCut/` : DXF files for laser-cut components used in the array assembly

- `/PhasePlate/`  
  Contains 3D printable model data for Bessel beam phase plate.

## Instructions

For detailed fabrication instructions and experimental procedures, please refer to the **Supplementary Materials** included with the manuscript.
